# Bank-Loan-Analysis
Python | Jupyter notebook
This project presents a structured exploratory data analysis (EDA) of bank loan applicant data using Python (Jupyter Notebook). The objective is to evaluate customer demographics, loan approval trends, credit risk indicators, and factors influencing loan defaults. The analysis converts raw loan data into actionable insights that support informed lending decisions and risk assessment.

Python Libraries:

pandas – data cleaning & transformation

numpy – statistical calculations

matplotlib, seaborn – visualization & distribution analysis

plotly – interactive visuals


Explored correlations between credit score, income stability, loan amount, and approval rate.

Build visual insights to support credit risk evaluation and loan portfolio monitoring.
